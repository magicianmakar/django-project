                            If you are facing technical difficulties -
                            please reach out to our Customer Success Team
                            via the chat option. We will work to get you back
                            to building your business!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If not technical, it is too often we see entrepreneurs
                            giving up on their eCommerce goals due to frustrations
                            or low levels of success. We’d like to change that.
                            If you’re interested, we offer a coaching call for guidance
                            on not only Dropified, but also:
