    <p>Hi {{username}},</p>

    <p>Just wanted to check in with you for 2 main reasons:</p>
    <p>
        1. Do you have any questions about setting up or using Dropified so far? I’d be glad to help out in any way that I can.<br/>

        2. Your Free Trial ends soon, in a matter of a few days. I wanted to make sure you were aware as you will be moved back to the free plan if you take no action which means that you won’t be able to connect to your Shopify store or use the automation features to add products or process your orders.</p>

    <p>If you would like to continue using Dropified to automate your drop shipping business, here’s your next steps:</p>

    <p>
        a. Login to Dropified and click the button at the top of your screen that says, “Enter Billing Info” or simply visit this link:
        <a href="https://app.dropified.com/user/profile#billing">https://app.dropified.com/user/profile</a> <br/>
        b. Simply enter your billing information and you are all set.<br/>
    </p>

    <p>
        You can cancel or modify your subscription at any time by visiting the  Plans & Subscriptions panel in your
        <a href="https://app.dropified.com/user/profile#plan">Dropified Profile</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I hope this make sense and let me know if you have any questions.<br/>
        Thanks,
    </p>
